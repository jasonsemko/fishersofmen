                    	<ul>
                    		<li>The coffee "box" at Starbucks and Coffee Bean comes with everything (sugar, milk, cups, stirrers, etc). With us averaging about 22ish it's probably safer to get 2 boxes but I'll leave that to you to decide. If you need any financial support for it let me know.</li>
                    		<li>Everyone has their choice for coffee but no matter where you get it it's best to call the night before. It can take about 15 minutes to put it together. Now by that logic you can also call around 6am and tell them you're coming. I've (Jason) been burned by that personally because Coffee Beans phone wasn't charged so no one picked up.</li>
