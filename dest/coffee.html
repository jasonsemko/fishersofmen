With us averaging about 22ish it's probably safer to get 2 boxes but I'll leave that to you to decide. If you need any financial support for it let me know.</li><li>Everyone has their choice for coffee but no matter where you get it it's best to call the night before. It can take about 15 minutes to put it together. Now by that logic you can also call around 6am and tell them you're coming. I've (Jason) been burned by that personally because Coffee Beans phone wasn't charged so no one picked up.</li></ul></section><section><h2>Leading</h2><table><tr><th>Time (AM)</th><th>Activity</th></tr><tr><td>6:30-6:35</td><td>Start: To start the meeting you can either verbally communicate to all attendees or ring the bowl that Lloyd brings.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Be Still Prayer, read this off slowly. Pause for a moment after each phrase while others repeat:<ul><li>Be Still and Know That I am God</li><li>Be Still and Know That I am</li><li>Be Still and Know</li><li>Be Still</li><li>Be</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Opening Prayer: Either you can say one prepared or choose someone in the group to open up.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Gospel reading: We typically read the daily gospel but if another verse is calling to you you can use that. If you choose your own explain to us why you felt it called to you. You can also designate this to someone else.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Groups: We will split into 3 or 4 tables depending upon the crowd, you have two choices:<ul><li>Count off (everyone counts from 1-4)</li><li>Everyone chooses themselves</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td></td><td style="background-color:#155F7D;color:#FFF"><strong>IMPORTANT RULES FOR CONVERSATION:</strong><ul><li>Lightly use the gospel reading as a base and encourage check-ins. A lot of us come many times a week but sometimes some of us come to get something out. We need to respect that so try your best to stay away from strict and confining themes for the day.</li><li>It is very important that we all remember to use "I" statements. We all have different personalities and different backgrounds and must respect that. We are not here to give anyone advice in the "you should do this.</li><li>We are here to love and listen, not to judge and advise.</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>7:40</td><td>Time keeper: You are also keeping time. We need to start and end on time. Ideally we start around 6:35-6:40. The earlier the coffee arrives the earlier we can start. When it gets to 7:40 we will end. Gather everyone up meet at the main table.</td></tr><tr><td>7:45</td><td>Ask how it went: Ask everyone to share a personal experience they gained from the day.</td></tr><tr><td>7:50</td><td>Prayer and Thanks: Everyone can now go in circle and give one thing they are grateful (or thankful for) and one thing for which they pray for. Remind them they need to keep it under 30 seconds.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Closing prayer: You can assign someone to do closing prayer or you can do it yourself.</td></tr></table></section></article></div></div><div class="footer-container"><footer class="wrapper"></footer></div></body></html>
